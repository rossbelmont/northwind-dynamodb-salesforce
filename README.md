# northwind-dynamodb-salesforce
This is intended to help Salesforce administrators and developers understand how to optimize External Objects that access data stored in [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html). We use the well-known Northwind sample for instructional purposes to see how a relational data model might be stored in a single table in DynamoDB, and how to unpack that table into multiple External Objects in Salesforce.

### Prerequisites
This example references [another repository](https://github.com/trek10inc/ddb-single-table-example) and its related [blog post](https://trek10.com/blog/dynamodb-single-table-relational-modeling/) that helps readers understand [the differences in data modeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-modeling-nosql.html) and provides scripts to populate DynamoDB. 

To walk through this example in its entirety, do the following:

- Step through [the Northwind sample](https://github.com/trek10inc/ddb-single-table-example) and populate DynamoDB with the relevant data.
- Create an External ID text field on the Account object called `customerID`.
- Import the data in [customers.csv](https://github.com/trek10inc/ddb-single-table-example/blob/master/csv/customers.csv) as Accounts and Contacts using the [Data Import Wizard](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/import-and-export-with-data-management-tools/use-the-data-import-wizard), being careful to import the first column into the new `customerID` field.
- Create External Objects for the different entities referenced hereâ€¦Orders, Products, etc.
  - You can import these samples directly with our [developer tools](https://developer.salesforce.com/developer-centers/developer-experience) or the Metadata API. If you don't need all that, you can create one or two objects by hand and experiment with the qualifiers.

### Qualifiers
This repo contains a number of examples of qualifiers for use with Salesforce Connect to read and write data stored in DynamoDB. The qualifier syntax is stored with the External Data Source metadata, though it is encoded/escaped and hard to read. Hence, for instructional purposes, it's separated out [in the doc folder](https://github.com/rossbelmont/northwind-dynamodb-salesforce/tree/main/doc) (even though the files in that folder can't be directly deployed to an org). There is also [commentary in the README of that folder](https://github.com/rossbelmont/northwind-dynamodb-salesforce/tree/main/doc#readme) that discusses what's interesting or relevant about each object.
